Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week; 1 hour / session

Prerequisite
------------

Graduate level Quantum Mechanics such as 8.321 (Quantum Theory I)

Description
-----------

8.323, Relativistic Quantum Field Theory I, is a one-term self-contained subject in quantum field theory.

Topics include: Classical field theory, symmetries, and Noether's theorem. Quantization of scalar fields, spin ½ fields, and Gauge bosons. Feynman graphs, analytic properties of amplitudes and unitarity of the S-matrix. Calculations in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Introduction to renormalization.

Grading
-------

The final grade for the course will be based entirely on the homework.

Homework Policy
---------------

There will normally be one problem set each week, due one week later in lecture. After attempting each problem by yourself, we encourage you to discuss the problems with the teaching staff and with each other — this is an excellent way to learn physics! However, you must write up your solutions by yourself.
